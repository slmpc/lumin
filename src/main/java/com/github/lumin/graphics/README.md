# Lumin Graphics

**English** | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Lumin Graphics is a lightweight, high-performance rendering framework 
designed for modern Minecraft modding.


### IMPORTANT: The English version may occasionally be out of sync.

## Features
- **SDF Rounded Rectangles**: Smooth, anti-aliased corners calculated via 
fragment shaders. Supports dynamic radii without vertex deformation.
- **High-Performance TTF**: Advanced TrueType Font rendering with atlas-based batching,
significantly reducing Draw Calls.

Here is the professional English translation and optimization of your **Quick Start** section. I have refined the technical terms to better match Minecraft modding standards and the "Lumin" aesthetic.

## Quick Start

Lumin Graphics performs all rendering through specialized **Renderers**.

### Available Renderers

* `RectRenderer`: Optimized for standard flat rectangles.
* `RoundRectRenderer`: For anti-aliased rectangles with dynamic corner radii.
* `TtfTextRenderer`: For high-performance TrueType font rendering.
* `TextureRenderer`：For drawing different textures.

### Initialization & Thread Safety

Renderers **must** be initialized on the **Render Thread**. We recommend using `Suppliers.memoize` (from Guava/Minecraft) to ensure safe, lazy initialization.

```java
// Recommended initialization
private final Supplier<RectRenderer> rectRenderer = Suppliers.memoize(RectRenderer::new);

// Use .get() to access the renderer instance
rectRenderer.get().addRect(10f, 10f, 100f, 100f, Color.WHITE);

```

### Usage Patterns

#### 1. Basic Draw & Reset

For most immediate-mode UI tasks, you will add shapes and clear the buffer in the same frame:

```java
// 1. Add shapes to the buffer
rectRenderer.get().addRect(10f, 10f, 200f, 200f, Color.WHITE);

// 2. Draw to screen and clear data for the next frame
rectRenderer.get().draw();
rectRenderer.get().clear(); 
// You can use drawAndClear() to instead

```

#### 2. Buffer Reusability

Lumin Renderers are designed for **persistent buffers**. If your UI doesn't change every frame, you can add vertices once and draw them multiple times across frames to save CPU cycles.

```java
// In your init or first frame:
rectRenderer.get().addRect(10f, 10f, 200f, 200f, Color.CYAN);

// In your rendering loop:
rectRenderer.get().draw(); // The content remains in the GPU buffer until .clear() is called.

```

### 💡 Optimization Note

Since you are using **Lumin Graphics**, remember that calling `.draw()` multiple times without `.clear()` is extremely efficient as it simply re-triggers the draw call on existing GPU data without re-uploading vertices.
